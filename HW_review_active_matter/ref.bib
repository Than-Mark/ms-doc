  abstract  = {Chiral active matter comprises particles which can self-propel and self-rotate. Examples range from sperm cells and bacteria near walls to autophoretic L-shaped colloids. In this perspective article we focus on recent developments in chiral active matter. After briefly discussing the motion of single particles, we discuss collective phenomena ranging from vortex arrays and patterns made of rotating micro-flocks to states featuring unusual rheological properties.}
