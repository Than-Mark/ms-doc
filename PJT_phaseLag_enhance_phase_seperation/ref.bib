  journal   = {Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General},
  abstract  = {We present a simple derivation of the stochastic equation obeyed by the density function for a system of Langevin processes interacting via a pairwise potential. The resulting equation is considerably different from the phenomenological equations usually used to describe the dynamics of non-conserved (model A) and conserved (model B) particle systems. The major feature is that the spatial white noise for this system appears not additively but multiplicatively. This simply expresses the fact that the density cannot fluctuate in regions devoid of particles. The steady state for the density function may, however, still be recovered formally as a functional integral over the coursed grained free energy of the system as in models A and B.}

  abstract = {It is shown that, in the infinite size limit, certain systems of globally coupled phase oscillators display low dimensional dynamics. In particular, we derive an explicit finite set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the macroscopic evolution of the systems considered. For example, an exact, closed form solution for the nonlinear time evolution of the Kuramoto problem with a Lorentzian oscillator frequency distribution function is obtained. Low dimensional behavior is also demonstrated for several prototypical extensions of the Kuramoto model, and time-delayed coupling is also considered.},

  abstract = {It is shown, under weak conditions, that the dynamical evolution of large systems of globally coupled phase oscillators with Lorentzian distributed oscillation frequencies is, in an appropriate physical sense, time-asymptotically attracted toward a reduced manifold of the system states. This manifold was previously known and used to facilitate the discovery of attractors and bifurcations of such systems. The result of this paper establishes that attractors for the order parameter dynamics obtained by restriction to this reduced manifold are, in fact, the only such attractors of the full system. Thus all long time dynamical behaviors of the order parameters of these systems can be obtained by restriction to the reduced manifold.},
