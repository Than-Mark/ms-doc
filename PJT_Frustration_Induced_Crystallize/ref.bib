  journal   = {Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General},
  abstract  = {We present a simple derivation of the stochastic equation obeyed by the density function for a system of Langevin processes interacting via a pairwise potential. The resulting equation is considerably different from the phenomenological equations usually used to describe the dynamics of non-conserved (model A) and conserved (model B) particle systems. The major feature is that the spatial white noise for this system appears not additively but multiplicatively. This simply expresses the fact that the density cannot fluctuate in regions devoid of particles. The steady state for the density function may, however, still be recovered formally as a functional integral over the coursed grained free energy of the system as in models A and B.}

  abstract = {It is shown that, in the infinite size limit, certain systems of globally coupled phase oscillators display low dimensional dynamics. In particular, we derive an explicit finite set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the macroscopic evolution of the systems considered. For example, an exact, closed form solution for the nonlinear time evolution of the Kuramoto problem with a Lorentzian oscillator frequency distribution function is obtained. Low dimensional behavior is also demonstrated for several prototypical extensions of the Kuramoto model, and time-delayed coupling is also considered.},

  abstract = {It is shown, under weak conditions, that the dynamical evolution of large systems of globally coupled phase oscillators with Lorentzian distributed oscillation frequencies is, in an appropriate physical sense, time-asymptotically attracted toward a reduced manifold of the system states. This manifold was previously known and used to facilitate the discovery of attractors and bifurcations of such systems. The result of this paper establishes that attractors for the order parameter dynamics obtained by restriction to this reduced manifold are, in fact, the only such attractors of the full system. Thus all long time dynamical behaviors of the order parameters of these systems can be obtained by restriction to the reduced manifold.},

  abstract = {By varying the concentration of molecules in the cytoplasm or on the membrane, cells can induce the formation of condensates and liquid droplets, similar to phase separation. Their thermodynamics, much studied, depends on the mutual interactions between microscopic constituents. Here, we focus on the kinetics and size control of 2D clusters, forming on membranes. Using molecular dynamics of patchy colloids, we model a system of two species of proteins, giving origin to specific heterotypic bonds. We find that concentrations, together with valence and bond strength, control both the size and the growth time rate of the clusters. In particular, if one species is in large excess, it gradually saturates the binding sites of the other species; the system then becomes kinetically arrested and cluster coarsening slows down or stops, thus yielding effective size selection. This phenomenology is observed both in solid and fluid clusters, which feature additional generic homotypic interactions and are reminiscent of the ones observed on biological membranes.},

  abstract = {Commanding the swimming of micrometric objects subjected to thermal agitation is always challenging for both artificial and living systems. Now, artificial swimmers can be designed with self-propelling force that can be tuned at will. However, orienting such small particles to an arbitrary direction requires counterbalancing the random rotational diffusion. Here, we introduce a simple concept to reorient artificial swimmers, granting them a motion similar to the run-and-tumbling behavior of Escherichia coli. We show it using Janus particles with asymmetric surface coating and moving under an ac electric field. Moreover, we determine the optimal strategy and compare it with biological swimmers. Our results encourage additional investigation into dynamical behavior of colloidal particles as well as application to microscopic devices. Although making artificial micrometric swimmers has been made possible by using various propulsion mechanisms, guiding their motion in the presence of thermal fluctuations still remains a great challenge. Such a task is essential in biological systems, which present a number of intriguing solutions that are robust against noisy environmental conditions as well as variability in individual genetic makeup. Using synthetic Janus particles driven by an electric field, we present a feedback-based particle-guiding method quite analogous to the “run-and-tumbling” behavior of Escherichia coli but with a deterministic steering in the tumbling phase: the particle is set to the run state when its orientation vector aligns with the target, whereas the transition to the “steering” state is triggered when it exceeds a tolerance angle α. The active and deterministic reorientation of the particle is achieved by a characteristic rotational motion that can be switched on and off by modulating the ac frequency of the electric field, which is reported in this work. Relying on numerical simulations and analytical results, we show that this feedback algorithm can be optimized by tuning the tolerance angle α. The optimal resetting angle depends on signal to noise ratio in the steering state, and it is shown in the experiment. The proposed method is simple and robust for targeting, despite variability in self-propelling speeds and angular velocities of individual particles.}

  abstract = {The mutation uni-1 gives rise to uniflagellate Chlamydomonas cells which rotate around a fixed point in the microscope field, so that the flagellar bending pattern can be photographed easily. This has allowed us to make a detailed analysis of the wild-type flagellar bending pattern and the bending patterns of flagella on several mutant strains. Cells containing uni-1, and recombinants of uni-1 with the suppressor mutations, suppf-1 and suppf-3, show the typical asymmetric bending pattern associated with forward swimming in Chlamydomonas, although suppf-1 flagella have about one-half the normal beta frequency, apparently as the result of defective function of the outer dynein arms. The pf-17 mutation has been shown to produce nonmotile flagella in which radial spoke heads and five characteristic axonemal polypeptides are missing. Recombinants containing pf-17 and either suppf-2 or suppf-3 have motile flagella, but still lack radial-spoke heads and the associated polypeptides. The flagellar bending pattern of these recombinants lacking radial-spoke heads is a nearly symmetric, large amplitude pattern which is quite unlike the wild-type pattern. However, the presence of an intact radial-spoke system is not required to convert active sliding into bending and is not required for bend initiation and bend propagation, since all of these processes are active in suppfpf-17 recombinants. The function of the radial-spoke system appears to be to convert the symmetric bending pattern displayed by these recombinants into the asymmetric bending pattern required for efficient swimming, by inhibiting the development of reverse bends during the recovery phase of the bending cycle.},

With increasing time after reactivation, fewer models swam in helices and more swam in circles. This transition from helical to circular swimming was the result of a progressive inactivation of one of the axonemes; in the extreme case, one axoneme was completely inactive whereas the other beat with a normal waveform. At these low Ca++ concentrations, the inactivated axoneme was the trans-axoneme (the one farthest from the eyespot) in 70-100\% of the models. At 10(-7) or 10(-6) M Ca++, cell models also proceeded from helical to circular swimming as a result of inactivation of one of the axonemes; however, under these conditions the cis-axoneme was usually the one that was inactivated. At 10(-8) M Ca++, most cells continued helical swimming, indicating that both axonemes were remaining relatively active. The progressive, Ca++-dependent inactivation of the trans- or cis-axoneme was reversed by switching the cell models to higher or lower Ca++ concentrations, respectively. A similar reversible, selective inactivation of the trans-flagellum occurred in intact cells swimming in medium containing 0.5 mM EGTA and no added Ca++. The results show that there are functional differences between the two axonemes of Chlamydomonas. The differential responses of the axonemes to submicromolar concentrations of Ca++ may form the basis for phototactic turning.},

Here, we probe the hydrodynamic flow field around a catalytically active colloid using particle tracking velocimetry both in the freely swimming state and when kept stationary with an external force. Our measurements provide information about the fluid velocity in the vicinity of the surface of the colloid, and confirm a mechanism for propulsion that was proposed recently. In addition to offering a unified understanding of the nonequilibrium interfacial transport processes at stake, our results open the way to a thorough description of the hydrodynamic interactions between such active particles and understanding their collective dynamics.},

  abstract = {Numerical models indicate that collective animal behavior may emerge from simple local rules of interaction among the individuals. However, very little is known about the nature of such interaction, so that models and theories mostly rely on aprioristic assumptions. By reconstructing the three-dimensional positions of individual birds in airborne flocks of a few thousand members, we show that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, as most current models and theories assume, but rather on the topological distance. In fact, we discovered that each bird interacts on average with a fixed number of neighbors (six to seven), rather than with all neighbors within a fixed metric distance. We argue that a topological interaction is indispensable to maintain a flock's cohesion against the large density changes caused by external perturbations, typically predation. We support this hypothesis by numerical simulations, showing that a topological interaction grants significantly higher cohesion of the aggregation compared with a standard metric one.}

  abstract = {Fish schools and bird flocks are fascinating examples of collective behaviours in which many individuals generate and interact with complex flows. Motivated by animal groups on the move, here we explore how the locomotion of many bodies emerges from their flow-mediated interactions. Through experiments and simulations of arrays of flapping wings that propel within a collective wake, we discover distinct modes characterized by the group swimming speed and the spatial phase shift between trajectories of neighbouring wings. For identical flapping motions, slow and fast modes coexist and correspond to constructive and destructive wing--wake interactions. Simulations show that swimming in a group can enhance speed and save power, and we capture the key phenomena in a mathematical model based on memory or the storage and recollection of information in the flow field. These results also show that fluid dynamic interactions alone are sufficient to generate coherent collective locomotion, and thus might suggest new ways to characterize the role of flows in animal groups.},

Here we show how a quantitative microscopic theory for directional ordering in a flock can be derived directly from field data. We construct the minimally structured (maximum entropy) model consistent with experimental correlations in large flocks of starlings. The maximum entropy model shows that local, pairwise interactions between birds are sufficient to correctly predict the propagation of order throughout entire flocks of starlings, with no free parameters. We also find that the number of interacting neighbors is independent of flock density, confirming that interactions are ruled by topological rather than metric distance. Finally, by comparing flocks of different sizes, the model correctly accounts for the observed scale invariance of long-range correlations among the fluctuations in flight direction.}

Dangers arise from uncontrolled collective motions, leading to compression against walls, suffocation and fatalities2--4. Our current understanding of crowd dynamics primarily relies on heuristic collision models, which effectively capture the behaviour observed in small groups of people5,6. However, the emergent dynamics of dense crowds, composed of thousands of individuals, remains a formidable many-body problem lacking quantitative experimental characterization and explanations rooted in first principles. Here we analyse the dynamics of thousands of densely packed individuals at the San Ferm{\'i}n festival (Spain) and infer a physical theory of dense crowds in confinement. Our measurements reveal that dense crowds can self-organize into macroscopic chiral oscillators, coordinating the orbital motion of hundreds of individuals without external guidance. Guided by these measurements and symmetry principles, we construct a mechanical model of dense-crowd motion. Our model demonstrates that emergent odd frictional forces drive a non-reciprocal phase transition7 towards collective chiral oscillations, capturing all our experimental observations. To test the robustness of our findings, we show that similar chiral dynamics emerged at the onset of the 2010 Love Parade disaster and propose a protocol that could help anticipate these previously unpredictable dynamics.},

Periodic stripe patterns are ubiquitous in living organisms, yet the underlying developmental processes are complex and difficult to disentangle. We describe a synthetic genetic circuit that couples cell density and motility. This system enabled programmed Escherichia coli cells to form periodic stripes of high and low cell densities sequentially and autonomously. Theoretical and experimental analyses reveal that the spatial structure arises from a recurrent aggregation process at the front of the continuously expanding cell population. The number of stripes formed could be tuned by modulating the basal expression of a single gene. The results establish motility control as a simple route to establishing recurrent structures without requiring an extrinsic pacemaker.}

  journal   = {Europhysics Letters},
  abstract  = {Using Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations we investigate the non-equilibrium structure formation of a two-dimensional (2D) binary system of dipolar colloids propelling in opposite directions. Despite a pronounced tendency for chain formation, the system displays a transition towards a laned state reminiscent of lane formation in systems with isotropic repulsive interactions. However, the anisotropic dipolar interactions induce novel features: First, the lanes have themselves a complex internal structure characterized by chains or clusters. Second, laning occurs only in a window of interaction strengths. We interpret our findings by a phase separation process and simple force balance arguments.}

  abstract  = {An active fluid denotes a viscous suspension of particles, cells, or macromolecules able to convert chemical energy into mechanical work by generating stresses on the microscale. By virtue of this internal energy conversion, these systems display unusual macroscopic rheological signatures, including a curious transition to an apparent superfluid-like state where internal activity exactly compensates viscous dissipation. These behaviors are unlike those of classical complex fluids and result from the coupling of particle configurations with both externally applied flows and internally generated fluid disturbances. Focusing on the well-studied example of a suspension of microswimmers, this review summarizes recent experiments, models, and simulations in this area and highlights the critical role played by the rheological response of these active materials in a multitude of phenomena, from the enhanced transport of passive suspended objects to the emergence of spontaneous flows and collective motion.}

Strong emphasis is put on the motivations for the chosen protocols and the experimental implementation. The first series deals with pattern formation, interactions between pedestrians, and decision-making in pedestrian groups at low to medium densities. In particular, we show how pedestrians adapt their headways in single-file motion depending on the (prescribed) leader’s velocity. The second series of experiments focuses on static crowds at higher densities, a situation that can be critical in real life and in which the pedestrians’ choices of motion are strongly constrained sterically. More precisely, we study the crowd’s response to its crossing by a pedestrian or a cylindrical obstacle of 74cm in diameter. In the latter case, for a moderately dense crowd, we observe displacements that quickly decay with the minimal distance to the obstacle, over a lengthscale of the order of the meter.},

  abstract = {Turbulent fluid motion is widespread in nature and is observed across diverse length and time scales, ranging from high-Reynolds number hydrodynamics to active fluids, such as bacterial suspensions and cytoskeletal extracts. It is recognized as one of the unsolved challenges in theoretical physics. Here, we explore out-of-equilibrium magnetic colloidal particles at liquid interfaces that exhibit complex collective behavior, resulting in emergence of an active spinner phase. Self-assembled spinners (active spinning without self-propulsion) induce vigorous vortical flows, demonstrating the properties of a 2D hydrodynamic turbulence. Our findings provide insight into the behavior of active spinner liquids and ways to control the collective dynamics and transport in active colloidal materials. Colloidal particles subject to an external periodic forcing exhibit complex collective behavior and self-assembled patterns. A dispersion of magnetic microparticles confined at the air–liquid interface and energized by a uniform uniaxial alternating magnetic field exhibits dynamic arrays of self-assembled spinners rotating in either direction. Here, we report on experimental and simulation studies of active turbulence and transport in a gas of self-assembled spinners. We show that the spinners, emerging as a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking of clock/counterclockwise rotation of self-assembled particle chains, generate vigorous vortical flows at the interface. An ensemble of spinners exhibits chaotic dynamics due to self-generated advection flows. The same-chirality spinners (clockwise or counterclockwise) show a tendency to aggregate and form dynamic clusters. Emergent self-induced interface currents promote active diffusion that could be tuned by the parameters of the external excitation field. Furthermore, the erratic motion of spinners at the interface generates chaotic fluid flow reminiscent of 2D turbulence. Our work provides insight into fundamental aspects of collective transport in active spinner materials and yields rules for particle manipulation at the microscale.}

In contrast clustering is readily visible in simulations modelling sperm within a methylcellulose medium, in line with previous observations that bovine sperm clustering is much more prominent in a rheological polyacrylamide medium. Furthermore, the fine-scale details of sperm flagellar movement substantially impact large-scale collective behaviours, further motivating the need for the digital microscopy and characterization of sperm to understand their dynamics.},

By comparing the hydrodynamic case with counterpart simulations for passive and active Brownian particles{,} we elucidate the relative roles of self-propulsion{,} interparticle attraction{,} and hydrodynamic interactions in determining clustering and phase behaviour. Even in the presence of an attractive potential{,} we find that hydrodynamic interactions strongly suppress the motility induced phase separation that might a priori have been expected in a highly active suspension. Instead{,} we find only a weak tendency for the particles to form stringlike clusters in this regime. At lower activities we demonstrate phase behaviour that is broadly equivalent to that of the counterpart passive system at low temperatures{,} characterized by regimes of gas–liquid{,} gas–solid and liquid–solid phase coexistence. In this way{,} we suggest that a dimensionless quantity representing the level of activity relative to the strength of attraction plays the role of something like an effective non-equilibrium temperature{,} counterpart to the (dimensionless) true thermodynamic temperature in the passive system. However there are also some important differences from the equilibrium case{,} most notably with regards the degree of hexatic ordering{,} which we discuss carefully.}

  journal   = {New Journal of Physics},
  abstract  = {We conduct a numerical study exploring the rotation of a symmetric gear driven by chiral particles in a two-dimensional box with periodic boundary conditions. The symmetric gear is submerged in a sea of chiral active particles. Surprisingly, even though the gear is perfectly symmetric, the microscopic random motion of chiral active particles can be converted into macroscopic directional rotation of the gear. (i) In the case of zero alignment interaction, the direction of rotation of the gear is determined by the chirality of active particles. Optimal parameters (the chirality, self-propelled speed, and packing traction) exist, at which the rotational speed reaches its maximum value. (ii) When considering a finite alignment interaction, alignment interactions between particles play an important role in driving the gear to rotate. The direction of rotation is dictated by the competition between the chirality of active particles and the alignment interactions between them. By tuning the system parameters, we can observe multiple rotation reversals. Our findings are relevant to understanding how the macroscopic rotation of a gear connects to the microscopic random motion of active particles.}

Non-reciprocity occurs, for instance, in active matter1--6, non-equilibrium systems7--9, networks of neurons10,11, social groups with conformist and contrarian members12, directional interface growth phenomena13--15 and metamaterials16--20. Although wave propagation in non-reciprocal media has recently been closely studied1,16--20, less is known about the consequences of non-reciprocity on the collective behaviour of many-body systems. Here we show that non-reciprocity leads to time-dependent phases in which spontaneously broken continuous symmetries are dynamically restored. We illustrate this mechanism with simple robotic demonstrations. The resulting phase transitions are controlled by spectral singularities called exceptional points21. We describe the emergence of these phases using insights from bifurcation theory22,23 and non-Hermitian quantum mechanics24,25. Our approach captures non-reciprocal generalizations of three archetypal classes of self-organization out of equilibrium: synchronization, flocking and pattern formation. Collective phenomena in these systems range from active time-(quasi)crystals to exceptional-point-enforced pattern formation and hysteresis. Our work lays the foundation for a general theory of critical phenomena in systems whose dynamics is not governed by an optimization principle.},

Our experiments show that rotors move collectively and exhibit super-diffusive interfacial motion and phase separate via spinodal decomposition. On long time scales, confinement favors symmetric demixing patterns.

  abstract = {We demonstrate that flagellated bacteria can be utilized in surface arrays (carpets) to achieve mixing in a low-Reynolds number fluidic environment. The mixing performance of the system is quantified by measuring the diffusion of small tracer particles. We show that the mixing performance responds to modifications to the chemical and thermal environment of the system, which affects the metabolic activity of the bacteria. Although the mixing performance can be increased by the addition of glucose (food) to the surrounding buffer or by raising the buffer temperature, the initial augmentation is also accompanied by a faster decay in mixing performance, due to falling pH and oxygen starvation, both induced by the higher metabolic activity of the bacterial system.},

  abstract = {Attempts to create microscopic artificial devices to emulate the swimming of bacteria and other cells have met with little success. Until now. The artificial swimmers that have achieved this feat are spermatozoa-like in appearance, but unlike spermatozoa move in the direction of their tail rather than head. Each swimmer is composed of a red blood cell attached to a DNA-linked chain of colloidal magnetic particles that acts as a magnetically driven `flagellum'. With this device it is possible to work out the optimal conditions for nanoscale swimming. It might even be useful for the precise positioning of tiny objects or for manipulating minute quantities of fluids.},
