  journal   = {Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General},
  abstract  = {We present a simple derivation of the stochastic equation obeyed by the density function for a system of Langevin processes interacting via a pairwise potential. The resulting equation is considerably different from the phenomenological equations usually used to describe the dynamics of non-conserved (model A) and conserved (model B) particle systems. The major feature is that the spatial white noise for this system appears not additively but multiplicatively. This simply expresses the fact that the density cannot fluctuate in regions devoid of particles. The steady state for the density function may, however, still be recovered formally as a functional integral over the coursed grained free energy of the system as in models A and B.}

  abstract  = {We demonstrate that active rotations in chemically signalling particles{,} such as autochemotactic E. coli close to walls{,} create a route for pattern formation based on a nonlinear yet deterministic instability mechanism. For slow rotations{,} we find a transient persistence of the uniform state{,} followed by a sudden formation of clusters contingent on locking of the average propulsion direction by chemotaxis. These clusters coarsen{,} which results in phase separation into a dense and a dilute region. Faster rotations arrest phase separation leading to a global travelling wave of rotors with synchronized roto-translational motion. Our results elucidate the physics resulting from the competition of two generic paradigms in active matter{,} chemotaxis and active rotations{,} and show that the latter provides a tool to design programmable self-assembly of active matter{,} for example to control coarsening.}
