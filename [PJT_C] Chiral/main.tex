\section{model}
Oscillators have a spatial position $\mathbf{r}_i=\left( x_i, y_i \right)$ and an internal phase $\theta_i$ which evoleve according to equations:

\begin{eqnarray}
    \dot{x}_i&=&v\cos \theta _i\;,\label{eq:dotxi}
  \\
    \dot{y}_i&=&v\sin \theta _i\;,\label{eq:dotyi}
  \\
    \dot{\theta}_i&=&\omega _i+\lambda \sum_{j=1}^N{A_{ij}\sin \left( \theta _j-\theta _i \right)}
    \label{eq:dotthetai}
\end{eqnarray}
for $i=1,2,\ldots,N$, where $N$ is the number of oscillators. As per Eq.~(\ref{eq:dotxi}) and (\ref{eq:dotyi}), each oscillator moves with a constant speed $v$ in the direction of its current phase $\theta_i$. The phase $\theta_i$ evolves according to Eq.~(\ref{eq:dotthetai}), where $\omega_i$ is the natural frequency of the $i$th oscillator, $\lambda$ is the coupling strength, and $A$ is the adjacency matrix of the network, with $A_{ij}=1$ if there is a connection from $i$th to $j$th oscillator, and $A_{ij}=0$ otherwise. We can consider Eq.~(\ref{eq:dotxi})-(\ref{eq:dotthetai}) as a generalization of the Kuramoto model and the Vicsek model in the sense that it includes both the phase and the spatial position of the oscillators.

Each oscillator $i$ is connected to all the oscillators within a
action radius $d_0$ of its position. The adjacency matrix $A$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
    A_{ij}=\begin{cases}
        1,&		\left| \mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_j \right|\le d_0\\
        0,&		\left| \mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_j \right|>d_0\\
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\left| \mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_j \right|$ is the Euclidean distance between the $i$th and $j$th oscillators. 

For simplicity, we consider oscillators are initially distributed uniformly in a two-dimensional square with side length $L$ and periodic boundary conditions. Their positions $\mathbf{r}_i\left( t \right) =\left( x_i\left( t \right) ,y_i\left( t \right) \right) $ at given time $t$ are given by:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{c}
        x_i\left( t+\Delta t \right) =x_i\left( t \right) +v\cos \theta _i\left( t \right) \Delta t\,\,\mathrm{mod}\ L,\\
        x_i\left( t+\Delta t \right) =x_i\left( t \right) +v\cos \theta _i\left( t \right) \Delta t\,\,\mathrm{mod}\ L,\\
    \end{array}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta t$ is the discrete time step. When two oscillators are on opposite sides of the square, the absolute value of the difference between one of their coordinates is greater than $L/2$. In this case, we take the minimum distance between them, which is the distance between the two points in the periodic boundary conditions. For a given pair of points $\mathbf{r}_i$ and $\mathbf{r}_j$, the distance between them is $\left| \mathbf{r}_i-\bar{\mathbf{r}}_j \right|$, where $\bar{\mathbf{r}}_j=\left( \bar{x}_j,\bar{y}_j \right)$ is the adjusted position of the $j$th oscillator, given by:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:adj_pos1}
    \bar{x}_j=\begin{cases}
        x_j,&		\left| x_i-x_j \right|\le L/2\\
        x_j+L,&		x_i-x_j>L/2\\
        x_j-L,&		x_j-x_i>L/2\\
    \end{cases},
    \\
    \bar{y}_j=\begin{cases}\label{eq:adj_pos2}
        y_j,&		\left| y_i-y_j \right|\le L/2\\
        y_j+L,&		y_i-y_j>L/2\\
        y_j-L,&		y_j-y_i>L/2\\
    \end{cases}.
\end{eqnarray}
$\left| \mathbf{r}_i-\bar{\mathbf{r}}_j \right|$ can be proved to be the minimum distance between $\mathbf{r}_i$ and $\mathbf{r}_j$ in the periodic boundary conditions (see the proof in Appendix \ref{sec:adj_pos}).

Finally, we consider that the natural frequencies $\omega_i$ are distributed in two symmetric uniform distributions, representing two types of chirality. Exactly half of the oscillators have natural frequencies in the range $\left[ \omega _{\min},\omega _{\max} \right]$ ($\omega_i \sim U\left( \omega _{\min},\omega _{\max} \right), i=1,2,\ldots,N/2$) and the other half in the range $\left[ -\omega _{\max},-\omega _{\min} \right]$ ($\omega_i \sim U\left( -\omega _{\max},-\omega _{\min} \right), i=N/2+1,N/2+2,\ldots,N$).

\end{figure}

We performed numerical simulations of the model to probe the behavior of its solutions (see Appendix \ref{sec:numerics} for details on the numerical methods). 
$N=1000$ oscillators were distributed uniformly in the square of length $L=10$ and their natural frequencies were distributed in the range $\left[ \omega _{\min},\omega _{\max} \right]=\left[ 1,3 \right]$ and $\left[ -\omega _{\max},-\omega _{\min} \right]=\left[ -3,-1 \right]$.
Two-parameter of coupling strength $\lambda$ and action radius $d_0$ are presented in the phase diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:phaseDiagram}. We found the system settles into five states: \textbf{Disorder}, \textbf{Ring}, \textbf{Swarm} (which can be further divided into \textbf{Multi-Clusters} and \textbf{Double-Clusters}), and \textbf{Quick Sync}. In Fig.~\ref{fig:phaseDiagram} we show the snapshots of the last three states and where these states are located in the phase diagram. The Disorder state is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:disorderState}a.
We next discuss these five states.

    }
\end{figure*}



\subsection{Disorder State}

Disorder state occurs when both $\lambda$ and $d_0$ are small. In this state, the oscillators are not asynchronous (phase histogram is uniform, like Fig.~\ref{fig:phaseHist}a) and move in a way which similar to uncoupled oscillators ($\lambda=0$), as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:disorderState}a. According to Eq.~(\ref{eq:dotxi})-(\ref{eq:dotthetai}), when $\lambda=0$, the equations of oscillators' motion can be written as:
\begin{eqnarray}
    x_i\left( t \right) =x_{i}^{0}+\frac{v}{\omega _i}\sin \left[ \theta _i\left( 0 \right) +\omega _it \right] \;,\label{eq:circlemotionx}\\
    y_i\left( t \right) =y_{i}^{0}-\frac{v}{\omega _i}\cos \left[ \theta _i\left( 0 \right) +\omega _it \right] \;.
\end{eqnarray}

Then we have
\begin{equation}
    \left( x_i -x_{i}^{0} \right) ^2+\left( y_i -y_{i}^{0} \right) ^2=\left( \frac{v}{\omega _i} \right) ^2\;.
\end{equation}
In such a setup, oscillators move in a circular trajectory with radius $v/\omega _i$ and the phases $\theta_i$ increase linearly with time, as show in Fig.~\ref{fig:disorderState}b. To calculate the real-time rotational radius, we first estimate real-time centers $\mathbf{c}(t)$ of the circular trajectory with method in Fig.~\ref{fig:CenterEps} and then solve the following linear equations:

\begin{figure}[b]
    \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{./figs/CenterEps.pdf}
    \caption{\label{fig:CenterEps} Estimation for real-time centers.
    $\mathbf{c}_i(t_j)$, $\mathbf{r}_i(t_j)$ and $\mathbf{v}_i(t_j)$ are the center of the circular trajectory, the position and the velocity of the $i$th oscillator at time $t_j$, respectively.
    The line from $\mathbf{c}_i(t_j)$ to $\mathbf{r}_i(t_j)$ is perpendicular to $\mathbf{v}_i(t_j)$.}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:linearEquations}
    \begin{array}{c}
        \mathbf{c}_i\left( t_1 \right) \cdot \mathbf{v}_i\left( t_1 \right) =\mathbf{x}_i\left( t_1 \right) \cdot \mathbf{v}_i\left( t_1 \right)\;,\\
        \mathbf{c}_i\left( t_2 \right) \cdot \mathbf{v}_i\left( t_2 \right) =\mathbf{x}_i\left( t_2 \right) \cdot \mathbf{v}_i\left( t_2 \right)\;,\\
    \end{array}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{v}_i(t_1)=\left( x_i\left( t_1 \right) , y_i\left( t_1 \right) \right)$ is the velocity of $i$th oscillator at $t_1$, and $\mathbf{v}_i(t_1)=\left( \cos \theta _i\left( t_1 \right) , \sin \theta _i\left( t_1 \right) \right)$ is the unit vector of the velocity. According to Eq.~(\ref{eq:dotxi})-(\ref{eq:dotthetai}), we can calculate $\mathbf{v}_i(t_2)$ and $\mathbf{r}_i(t_2)$, ($t_2=t_1+\Delta t$). 
 
\begin{figure*}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./figs/radiusOmega.png}
    \caption{
        \label{fig:radiusOmega} The real-time and analytical rotational radius.

        All the above simulations are calculated at $t=60000$. 
    }
\end{figure*}

The real-time rotational radius is $r_i(t)=\left| \mathbf{c}_i(t)-\mathbf{r}_i(t) \right|$. We found that the real-time rotational radius is almost constant and close to $v/\omega_i$ for each oscillator in the Disorder state, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:radiusOmega}a. The estimation results of four states's real-time rotational centers are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:etimateCenter} in Appendix.

        The centers position are estimated with method in Fig.~\ref{fig:CenterEps} and Eq.~(\ref{eq:linearEquations}).
    }
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Ring State}

The Ring state is characterized by the oscillators forming several rings with thickness, each of which is composed of oscillators with the same chirality, as is show in Fig.~\ref{fig:phaseDiagram}a. 
Similar to Disorder state, the oscillators in the same ring cluster move in a circular trajectory with a constant rotational radius calculated in Fig.~\ref{fig:radiusOmega}a. 
The oscillators' phase is uniformly distributed in the range $\left[ -\pi,\pi \right]$ (cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:phaseHist}a), which leads to oscillators uniformly located on the circular trajectory.
Fig.~\ref{fig:centersPosition}a shows there is a long transient time before this state is reached, and in this transient time, the trajectories of oscillators with the same chirality aggregate slowly. Conversely, the oscillators with different chirality repel each other. 


\subsection{Swarm State}

Swarm State is a state where the oscillators form spatial clusters and align into several clusters [Fig.~\ref{fig:phaseDiagram}b, c and Fig.~\ref{fig:centersPosition}b]. When $\lambda$ and $d_0$ increases, the number of clusters decreases by 2, which is named by Double-Clusters state, and other states are named by Multi-Clusters state. The clusters are composed of oscillators with the same chirality, and the phase $\theta_i$ of the oscillators in the same cluster is synchronized as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:phaseHist}b and \ref{fig:phaseHist}c, which means that the oscillators in the cluster move with the same velocity $\mathbf{v}_i=\left( \cos \theta _s,\ \sin \theta _s \right)$ and rotational radius $r_i=v/\theta_s$, where $\theta_s$ is the oscillators' phase in the cluster. Based on this property, we can calculate $\theta_s$ and $r_i$ with Eq.~(\ref{eq:dotthetai}):

\begin{equation}\label{eq:clusterState}
    \begin{aligned}
        N_s\omega _s&=\sum_{i=1}^{N_s}{\left( \omega _i+\lambda \sum_{j=1}^{N_s}{A_{ij}\sin \left( \theta _j-\theta _i \right)} \right)}\\
        \omega _s&=\frac{1}{N_s}\sum_{i=1}^{N_s}{\omega _i}+\frac{\lambda}{N_s}\sum_{i=1}^{N_s}{\sum_{j=1}^{N_s}{A_{ij}\sin \left( \theta _j-\theta _i \right)}}\\
        &=\frac{1}{N_s}\sum_{i=1}^{N_s}{\omega _i}\;,\\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $N_s$ is the number of oscillators in the cluster.
As $\omega_i \sim U\left( \omega _{\min},\omega _{\max} \right)$ and $\omega_i \sim U\left( -\omega _{\max},-\omega _{\min} \right)$ for two types of chirality, we can calculate $\theta_i$, $\omega_s$ and $r_i$ with $\omega_i$ for Double-Clusters state:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}\label{eq:clusterState2}
        \theta _i&=\omega _s=\begin{cases}
        \left( \omega _{\max}+\omega _{\min} \right) /2,&		i=1,2,\dots ,N/2\\
        -\left( \omega _{\max}+\omega _{\min} \right) /2,&		i=N/2+1,\cdots ,N\\
    \end{cases}\,\,,\\
        r_i&=\frac{v}{\left|\omega _s\right|}\;,\\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:radiusOmega}b. But for Multi-Clusters, due to which oscillators are synchronized within each cluster is not accurately known, we can only calculate the real-time rotational radius of the them. As seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:radiusOmega}b, similar to Double-Clusters, some local platforms appear in the real-time rotational radius due to synchronization.

\subsection{Quick Sync State}

Quick Sync state is a simple state where total oscillators are synchronized quickly, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phaseDiagram}d. and \ref{fig:phaseHist}d. The oscillators are synchronized in an extremely short time, which leads them have no time to form clusters (can also be considered as a special case of Swarm state). Due to the two types of chirality oscillators are synchronized and the distributions of them is symmetric, the phase velocities of total oscillators are close to zero according to Eq.~(\ref{eq:clusterState}).

    }
\end{figure*}

\section{Order Parameter}

Having described the four states of our system, we next discuss how to distinguish them. We use the order parameter $R$ to measure global synchronization. The order parameter $R$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
    R=\left| \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N{e^{i\theta _j}} \right|\;.
\end{equation}
The order parameter $R$ is the absolute value of the mean of the complex numbers $e^{i\theta _i}$, which can be interpreted as the mean direction of the oscillators. When $R=1$, the oscillators are completely synchronized, and when $R=0$, the oscillators are completely desynchronized. Fig \ref{fig:orderParam}a shows the order parameter $R$ in the parameter plane. The order parameter $R$ is close to $1$ in the Quick Sync state, close to $0$ in the Disorder state and most of the Ring state, and between $0$ and $1$ in other states. In these states, we see that the order parameter $R$ changes non-monotonically in the sense that phases in these states are not globally synchronized, and each cluster's phase velocity $\omega_s\ne 0$. When the phases of different clusters are exactly equal, the order parameter $R$ is close to $1$, and when they are exactly opposite, $R$ is close to $0$.

Having realized that the order parameter $R$ is not enough to distinguish the states with clusters, we next define the following order parameter $R_s$ to metric the local synchronization,

\begin{equation}
    R_s=\frac{1}{N_c}\sum_{k=1}^{N_c}{\left| \frac{1}{\left| C_k \right|}\sum_{j\in C_k}{e^{i\theta _j}} \right|}\;,
\end{equation}
where $N_c$ is the number of clusters, $C_k$ is the $k$th cluster, and $\left| C_k \right|$ is the number of oscillators in the $k$th cluster. We can consider $R_s$ as an order parameter that studies the spatial position and internal phase simultaneously.
To determine the classification of clusters, we use the following method: we first calculate the relative center distance matrix $D_{ij}=\left| \mathbf{c}_i-\bar{\mathbf{c}}_j \right|$, where $\bar{\mathbf{c}}_j=\left( \bar{x}_j,\bar{y}_j \right)$ is the adjusted position of the $j$th oscillator's rotational center calculated by Eq.~(\ref{eq:adj_pos1}), (\ref{eq:adj_pos2}) and (\ref{eq:linearEquations}). 
The reason of using the distance between centers instead of the distance between oscillators' positions is that the oscillators in the Ring state are uniformly distributed on the circular trajectory, and the distance between them is much larger than the distance between their centers.
Then we use the DBSCAN algorithm to cluster the oscillators. The DBSCAN algorithm is a density-based clustering algorithm, which can find clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes. We set the minimum number of oscillators in a cluster to be $5$ and the maximum distance between two oscillators in the same cluster to be $0.3$ (see Appendix \ref{sec:DBSCAN_param} for details on the determination of these parameters). 
One example of the classification of clusters is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:classifyResult}.
We then calculate the order parameter $R_s$ for each cluster. The order parameter $R_s$ is close to $1$ in the Swarm state ($R_s$ of Double-Clusters state is closer to $1$ than Multi-Clusters) and Quick Sync state, and close to $0$ in Disorder state and most of the Ring state, between $0$ and $1$ in other Ring states with local clusters, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:orderParam}b.

\begin{figure}[b]
    \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{./figs/classifyResult.pdf}
    \caption{
        \label{fig:classifyResult} Two examples of classification results. \textbf{(a)}: ($\lambda=0.4$, $d_0=0.3$). \textbf{(b)}: ($\lambda=0.02$, $d_0=0.4$).
    }
\end{figure}

Combining the order parameter $R$ and $R_s$, we can find only the distinction between Ring and Disorder states has not been resolved. Except the study for synchronization, we alse define an order parameter $\Delta \Omega$ to metric the phase locking of the oscillators:

\begin{equation}
    \Delta \Omega =\frac{1}{N_c}\sum_{k=1}^{N_c}{\left[ \frac{1}{\left| C_k \right|^2}\sum_{i,j\in C_k}{\left( \left< \dot{\theta}_i \right> -\left< \dot{\theta}_j \right> \right) ^2} \right]}\;,
\end{equation}
where $\left< \dot{\theta}_i \right>$ is the average of the phase velocity of the $i$th cluster, which can be calculated by
\begin{equation}
    \left< \dot{\theta}_i \right> =\lim_{T\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{T}\int_{t_0}^{t_0+T}{\dot{\theta}_i\left( t \right) \mathrm{d}t}\;.
\end{equation}
We estimate $\left< \dot{\theta}_i \right>$ by the average of the phase velocity of the oscillators in the $i$th cluster at the last $1000$ time steps. 
The order parameter $\Delta \Omega > 0$ in the Disorder state, and $\Delta \Omega = 0$ in other states, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:orderParam}c.

To sum up, using $R$, $R_s$ and $\Delta \Omega$ in combination allows us to discern all the equilibrium state of our system.
The order parameter values in each state are summarized in Table \ref{tab:orderParam}.

\section{Analysis}

\subsection{\label{critical} Analytical approximations of the critical boundaries}

In this section we derive the analytical approximations of the boundaries between the states. 
The boundaries between the states are determined by the critical lines $\lambda_{c1}$, $\lambda_{c2}$, $\lambda_{c3}$, and $\lambda_{c4}$, which are the critical values of $\lambda$ for the transitions between the states with given $d_0$.

\subsubsection{$\lambda_{c1}$: Disorder to Ring}

We first consider the transition between the Disorder and Ring states. The oscillators in both states move in a circular trajectory (cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:disorderState}b), and the difference between them is that the oscillators in the Ring state are phase-locked.
Therefore, oscillators in Disorder state have a very small probability of being randomly distributed on the ring, but without phase locking.
The critical coupling strength $\lambda_{c1}$ can be calculated as the critical value of $\lambda$ for the phase locking of oscillators on the same ring.
We consider the following synchronous dynamics of oscillators on the same ring:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \dot{\theta}_1&=&\omega _1+\lambda \sum_{j=2}^{N_c}{A_{1j}\sin \left( \theta _j-\theta _1 \right)}\;,\label{eq:dotTheta1}
    \\
    \dot{\theta}_j&=&\omega _j\;,\label{eq:dotThetaj}
\end{eqnarray}
for $j=2,3,\ldots,N_c$, where $N_c$ is the number of oscillators on the same ring, and $\theta _1$ is the phase of the oscillator about to be phase-locked. Introducing the phase difference $\Delta \theta _j=\theta _j-\theta _1$ and $\Delta \omega _j=\omega _j-\omega _1$, we have:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:dotDeltaTheta}
    \Delta\dot{\theta}_j=\Delta \omega _j+\lambda \sum_{k=2}^{N_c}{A_{jk}\sin \Delta \theta _k}\;.
\end{equation}
Each oscillator only needs to be phase-locked with neighboring oscillators (minimum $\left| \Delta \omega _j \right|$) to achieve phase locking of entire ring due to the symmetry.
The minimum $\left| \Delta \omega _j \right|$ in a ring is $\left| \Delta \omega _j \right|=\left( \omega _{\max}-\omega _{\min} \right) /N_c$. When $\lambda \sum_{k=2}^{N_c}{A_{jk}} \geqslant \left| \Delta \omega _j \right|$, Eq.~(\ref{eq:dotDeltaTheta}) has fixed point solutions, and the oscillators are phase-locked. Therefore, the critical coupling strength $\lambda_{c1}$ is:
\begin{equation}
    \lambda _{c1}=\frac{\omega _{\max}-\omega _{\min}}{N_c\sum\nolimits_{j=2}^{N_c}{A_{1j}}}\;,
\end{equation}
where $\sum\nolimits_{j=2}^{N_c}{A_{1j}}$ is the number of oscillators within the action scope of the $1$st oscillator on the ring. Obviously, this is a function of $d_0$. We define it as
\begin{equation}
    N_1\left( d_0 \right) =N_c\frac{S_1\left( d_0 \right)}{S_R}=\frac{N_cS_1\left( d_0 \right)}{\pi \left( r_{\max}^{2}-r_{\min}^{2} \right)}\;,
\end{equation}
where $S_1$ is the overlapping area of the action scope of the $1$st oscillator and the ring, $S_R$ is the area of the ring, and $r_{\max}=v/\omega_{\min}$ and $r_{\min}=v/\omega_{\max}$ are the outer and inner radius of the ring, respectively. In order to achieve phase locking of all oscillators on the ring, we need to consider the minimum value of $N_1\left( d_0\right)$. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:analyticalEps}a, the $1$st oscillator is at point $A$ which is on the outer edge of the ring, and the overlapping area of the yellow circle (action scope) and the red ring is $S_1\left( d_0 \right)$.  Elementary geometry gives 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:S1}
    \begin{cases}
        S_1\left( d_0 \right) =d_{0}^{2}\frac{\alpha}{2}+r_{\max}^{2}\frac{\beta}{2}-r_{\max}d_0\sin \frac{\alpha}{2}\\
        \beta =2\mathrm{arc}\cos \left( 1-\frac{d_{0}^{2}}{2r_{\max}^{2}} \right)\\
        \alpha =\pi -\frac{\beta}{2}\\
    \end{cases}\;,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the angles of sectors from two overlapping circles' centers. Overall, we have
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
        \lambda _{c1}=\frac{\pi \left( r_{\max}^{2}-r_{\min}^{2} \right) \left( \omega _{\max}-\omega _{\min} \right)}{N_{c}^{2}\left( d_{0}^{2}\frac{\alpha}{2}+r_{\max}^{2}\frac{\beta}{2}-r_{\max}d_0\sin \frac{\alpha}{2} \right)}\\
        \beta =2\mathrm{arc}\cos \left( 1-\frac{d_{0}^{2}}{2r_{\max}^{2}} \right)\\
        \alpha =\pi -\frac{\beta}{2}\\
    \end{cases}\;.
\end{equation}
Then we can calculate the critical line $\lambda_{c1}$ in the $(\lambda$-$d_0)$ plane with $N_c=250$ (Ring state first appears as four rings, more details in Subsection \ref{sec:numRings}), as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:orderParam}c, where the line accurately divides the phase-locked and non-phase-locked regions.

\subsubsection{$\lambda_{c2}$: Ring to Swarm (Multi-Clusters)}

According to $R_s$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:orderParam}b, the oscillators in the cluster are synchronized, and the oscillators with different chirality are not synchronized. Therefore, $\lambda_{c2}$ is the critical value of $\lambda$ for the synchronization of oscillators in the same cluster. We still consider the synchronous dynamics in Eq.~(\ref{eq:dotTheta1}) and (\ref{eq:dotThetaj}). To achieve synchronization, the oscillators with the largest phase difference (maximum $\left| \Delta \omega _j \right|$) in the cluster need to be phase locked. The maximum $\left| \Delta \omega _j \right|$ in a cluster is $\left| \Delta \omega _j \right|=\omega _{\max}-\omega _{\min}$. Thus, the critical coupling strength $\lambda_{c2}$ is:
\begin{equation}
    \lambda _{c2}=\frac{\omega _{\max}-\omega _{\min}}{\sum\nolimits_{j=2}^{N_s}{A_{1j}}}\;,
\end{equation}
where $N_s$ is the number of oscillators in the cluster, and $\sum\nolimits_{j=2}^{N_s}{A_{1j}}$ is the number of oscillators within the action scope of the $1$st oscillator in the cluster, which is $N_2\left( d_0 \right)$. We define it as

\begin{equation}
    N_2\left( d_0 \right) =N_s\frac{S_2\left( d_0 \right)}{S_S}=\frac{N_sS_2\left( d_0 \right)}{\pi r_{s}^{2}}\;,
\end{equation}
where $S_2$ is the overlapping area of the action scope of the $1$st oscillator and the cluster, $S_S$ is the area of the cluster. Considering that this is a phase transition between ring and cluster states, the oscillator moves with a rotational radius in the ring state until it gathers into clusters, so the radius of the cluster $r_s$ is $(r_{\max}-r_{\min})/2$, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:analyticalEps}b. Similar to Eq.~(\ref{eq:S1}),the minimum overlapping area $S_2$ (overlapping area of two circles in Fig.~\ref{fig:analyticalEps}b) can be calculated as
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
        S_2\left( d_0 \right) =d_{0}^{2}\frac{\alpha}{2}+r_{s}^{2}\frac{\beta}{2}-r_sd_0\sin \frac{\alpha}{2}\\
        \beta =2\mathrm{arc}\cos \left( 1-\frac{d_{0}^{2}}{2r_{s}^{2}} \right)\\
        \alpha =\pi -\frac{\beta}{2}\\
    \end{cases}\;.
\end{equation}
Therefore, we have

\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
        \lambda _{c2}=\frac{\pi r_{s}^{2}\left( \omega _{\max}-\omega _{\min} \right)}{N_S\left( d_{0}^{2}\frac{\alpha}{2}+r_{s}^{2}\frac{\beta}{2}-r_sd_0\sin \frac{\alpha}{2} \right)}\\
        \beta =2\mathrm{arc}\cos \left( 1-\frac{d_{0}^{2}}{2r_{s}^{2}} \right)\\
        \alpha =\pi -\frac{\beta}{2}\\
        r_s=\frac{r_{\max}-r_{\min}}{2}\\
    \end{cases}\;.
\end{equation}
Then we can calculate the critical line $\lambda_{c2}$ in the $(\lambda$-$d_0)$ plane with $N_s=500$ (each chirality has half of the total population $N=1000$), as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:orderParam}b, where the line divides whether local synchronization occurred.

\subsubsection{$\lambda_{c3}$: Multi-Clusters to Double-Clusters}

The derivation of $\lambda_{c3}$ is similar to that of $\lambda_{c2}$, but the difference is that the centers of oscillators in the Swarm (Double-Clusters) state converge quickly (cf Fig.~\ref{fig:centersPosition}b), which means oscillators do not require a long transient to form clusters. We consider that the oscillator density $\rho$ (Number of oscillators per unit area) under initial conditions can achieve synchronization of oscillators of the same chirality. $\rho$ can be calculated as 
\begin{equation}
    \rho =\frac{N}{L^2}\;.
\end{equation}
Then we have 
\begin{eqnarray}
    \sum_{j=2}^{N_c}{A_{1j}}=\rho \pi d_{0}^{2}=\frac{N\pi d_{0}^{2}}{L^2}\;.
\end{eqnarray}
The critical coupling strength $\lambda_{c3}$ is:
\begin{equation}
    \lambda _{c3}=\frac{L^2\left( \omega _{\max}-\omega _{\min} \right)}{N\pi d_{0}^{2}}\;.
\end{equation}
Similarly, we can calculate the critical line $\lambda_{c3}$ in the $(\lambda$-$d_0)$ plane, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:orderParam}b, where the values of region above the line (Double-Clusters) is closer to $1$ than below the line (Multi-Clusters).

\subsubsection{$\lambda_{c4}$: Swarm (Double-Clusters) to Quick Sync}
The Quick Sync state can be considered as a special case of the Swarm state where the oscillators are globally synchronized. Our derivation approach comes from adiabatic parameter tuning (see Appendix \ref{sec:Adiabatic}). We assume that the oscillators of two chiralities have been synchronized in the Swarm (Double-Clusters) state, as is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:analyticalEps}c. Next, we consider the synchronization of the two chiralities. According to Eq.~(\ref{eq:clusterState2}), two clusters with opposite chirality are moving on their respective circular trajectories with the same rotational radius
\begin{equation}
    r_c = \cfrac{2v}{\omega_{\max}+\omega_{\min}}\;.
\end{equation}
In numerical simulations, we observe that the radius $r_s$ of clusters in Swarm state increases with the increase of $\lambda$ and $d_0$. Thus, the radius of the clusters reach maximum value of $r_c$ (see proof in Appendix \ref{sec:maxRadius}) when the $\lambda$ and $d_0$ reach the critical values.

Considering that the trajectories of two chiralities will repel each other before oscillators achieving global synchronization, let's take the maximum relative distance between the motion trajectories of two clusters in space, which is line $AB$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:analyticalEps}c. The distance $l_{AB}$ is
\begin{equation}
    l_{AB}=\frac{L}{\sqrt{2}}\;.
\end{equation}

Similar to the derivation of $\lambda_{c2}$, we consider the synchronization dynamics between a single oscillator ($C$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:analyticalEps}c) and a cluster (blue circle in Fig.~\ref{fig:analyticalEps}c), the difference is that the single oscillator and cluster here belong to different chirality. When the centers of two clusters move onto line segment AB, their distance is the shortest. At this point, due to symmetry, if the oscillators at the edges of the two clusters are synchronized, global synchronization can be achieved. Obviously, when 

\begin{equation}
    d_0+2r_c+2r_s<l_{AB}\;,
\end{equation}
the action scope of oscillator at point $C$ does not overlap with the neg-chirality cluster (blue circle), so the critical coupling strength $\lambda_{c4}$ does not exist. When $d_0+2r_c+2r_s>l_{AB}$, the overlapping area $S_3\left( d_0 \right)$ can be calculated as
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
        S_3\left( d_0 \right) =r_{s}^{2}\frac{\alpha}{2}+d_{0}^{2}\frac{\beta}{2}-d_0r_d\sin \frac{\beta}{2}\\
        r_d=\frac{L}{\sqrt{2}}-r_s-2r_c\\
        \beta =2\mathrm{arc}\cos \frac{d_{0}^{2}+r_{d}^{2}-r_{s}^{2}}{2d_0r_d}\\
        \alpha =2\mathrm{arc}\cos \frac{r_{s}^{2}+r_{d}^{2}-d_{0}^{2}}{2r_sr_d}\\
    \end{cases}\;,
\end{equation}
where $r_s=r_c$. The global maximum value of $\left| \Delta \omega _j \right|$ is $\omega _{\max}-\left( -\omega _{\max} \right) =2\omega _{\max}$. Therefore, we have

\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
        \lambda _{c4}=\frac{2\pi r_{s}^{2}\omega _{\max}}{N_c\left( \frac{\alpha}{2}r_{s}^{2}+\frac{\beta}{2}d_{0}^{2}-d_0r_d\sin \frac{\beta}{2} \right)}\\
        r_d=\frac{L}{\sqrt{2}}-r_s-2r_c\\
        \beta =2\mathrm{arc}\cos \frac{d_{0}^{2}+r_{d}^{2}-r_{s}^{2}}{2d_0r_d}\\
        \alpha =2\mathrm{arc}\cos \frac{r_{s}^{2}+r_{d}^{2}-d_{0}^{2}}{2r_sr_d}\\
    \end{cases}\;.
\end{equation}
Then we can calculate the critical line $\lambda_{c4}$ in the $(\lambda$-$d_0)$ plane, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:orderParam}a, where the line divides whether global synchronization occurred.

\subsection{Repulsion-attraction mechanism from chiralities}

Under the assumption of no coupling, the center $\mathbf{c}_i$ of the $i$th oscillator moves on a circular trajectory with radius $r_i=v/\omega_i$ and angular velocity $\omega_i$. 
Therefore, the coordinates of the rotation center can be estimated as the coordinates of points on the trajectory.
According to Eq.~(\ref{eq:circlemotionx}), the horizontal ordinate of the $i$th oscillator's rotation center is
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        C_{xi}\left( t_0 \right) &=\frac{\omega _i}{2\pi}\int_{t_0}^{t_0+2\pi /\omega _i}{\left\{ x_{i}^{0}\left( t_0 \right) +\frac{v}{\omega _i}\sin \left[ \theta _i\left( t_0 \right) +\omega _it \right] \right\} \mathrm{d}t}\\
        &=x_{i}^{0}\left( t_0 \right)\\
        &=x_i\left( t_0 \right) -\frac{v}{\omega _i}\sin \theta _i\left( t_0 \right)\;.\\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Similarly, the vertical ordinate of the $i$th oscillator's rotation center is
\begin{equation}
    C_{yi}\left( t_0 \right) =y_i\left( t_0 \right) +\frac{v}{\omega _i}\cos \theta _i\left( t_0 \right)\;.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \left| \mathbf{c}_j-\mathbf{c}_i \right|=\sqrt{\begin{array}{l}
        \left( x_j-\frac{v}{\omega _j}\sin \theta _j-x_i+\frac{v}{\omega _i}\sin \theta _i \right) ^2+\\
        \left( y_j+\frac{v}{\omega _j}\cos \theta _j-y_i-\frac{v}{\omega _i}\cos \theta _i \right) ^2\\
    \end{array}}
\end{equation}

\appendix

\section{\label{sec:adj_pos} PROOF OF THE ADJUSTED POSITION}

In this section, we prove the distances between oscillators' adjusted position is the minimum distance in periodic boundary conditions. 

\begin{proof}
    To prove this, we only need to prove the adjusted distance $\left| \mathbf{r}_i-\bar{\mathbf{r}}_j \right|$ is not longer than the raw distance $\left| \mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_j \right|$.
    
    For $\left( x_i-x_j \right) ^2$ and $\left( x_i-\bar{x_j} \right) ^2$, if $x_j=\bar{x_j}$, we have $\left( x_i-x_j \right) ^2=\left( x_i-\bar{x_j} \right) ^2$. If $x_j\ne \bar{x_j}$, we have

    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
            \left( x_i-\bar{x}_j \right) ^2-\left( x_i-x_j \right) ^2&=\left( x_j\pm L-x_i \right) ^2-\left( x_j-x_x \right) ^2\\
            &=\begin{cases}
            L^2+2L\left( x_j-x_x \right) ,&		x_i-x_j>L/2\\
            L^2-2L\left( x_j-x_x \right) ,&		x_i-x_j<L/2\\
        \end{cases}\\
            &<L^2-L^2\\
            &=0\\
        \end{aligned}\;.
    \end{equation}

    Then, we have $\left( x_i-\bar{x}_j \right) ^2\leqslant \left( x_i-x_j \right) ^2$. Similarly, we have $\left( y_i-\bar{y}_j \right) ^2\leqslant \left( y_i-y_j \right) ^2$. Therefore, we have 

    \begin{equation}
        \begin{aligned}
            \left| \mathbf{r}_i-\bar{\mathbf{r}}_j \right|&=\sqrt{\left( x_i-\bar{x}_j \right) ^2+\left( y_i-\bar{y}_j \right) ^2}\\
            &\leqslant \sqrt{\left( x_i-x_j \right) ^2+\left( y_i-y_j \right) ^2}\\
            &=\left| \mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_j \right|\;.
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}

\end{proof}


\section{\label{sec:numerics} NUMERICAL METHODS}

All the simulations of the model Eq.~(\ref{eq:dotxi})-(\ref{eq:dotthetai}) were run on Python using Euler integration, with a time step $\Delta t=0.01$, and a total time of $T=60000$. 


\section{\label{sec:DBSCAN_param} DETERMINATION OF DBSCAN'S PARAMETERS}

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering algorithm, which can find clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes. The algorithm has two parameters: $\varepsilon$ and $m$. $\varepsilon$ is the maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as in the neighborhood of the other, and $m$ is the minimum number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point. 

We traverse all values between $0.15$ and $0.5$ with a step length of $0.05$, and for each value of $\varepsilon$, we calculate the number of clusters of Swarm state with $m=5$ (which is $0.5\%$ of the population $N=1000$ of the system). Then we record the minimum counts of clusters in total states. 

\begin{figure}[H]

        \label{fig:DBSCANparam} The minimum counts of clusters with $m=0$ and different $\varepsilon$. The number of clusters is calculated by DBSCAN algorithm. 
    }
\end{figure}
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DBSCANparam}, the mean counts of clusters converges to at $\varepsilon=0.3$. Then we set $\varepsilon$ to be $0.3$, and set $m$ to be $5$.

\section{\label{sec:maxRadius} PROOF OF THE MAXIMUM RADIUS OF CLUSTERS}

In this section, we prove the maximum radiu of cluster in the Swarm state is $r_c$, which is the radius of its rotation trajectory. We prove this by contradiction.

\begin{proof}
    We assume that the maximum radius of the cluster is $r_s>r_c$. Then we have the case that the cluster's rotation center is inside the cluster circle with radius $r_s$. 
    Fig.~\ref{fig:rsProofEps} shows the schematic plot of this case. $A$ and $B$ is the center of the cluster and trajectory circle, respectively. The cluster circle is divided into two parts by $B$: red solid and red // hatching. In order to enable clusters to move along trajectories, the oscillators in two parts must have contrary phase velocities. This contradicts the fact that the oscillators in the cluster are synchronized. Therefore, the maximum radius of the cluster is $r_c$.
