NOTE: While submitting the revised manuscript, please double check the author names provided in the submission so that authorship related changes are made in the revision stage. Any authorship-related change after acceptance will involve approval from co-authors and respective editor handling the submission and this may cause a significant delay in publishing your manuscript.

Reviewers' comments:



Reviewer #1: The authors have considered the simplified model for chiral swarmalators [1] by neglecting the attractive and repulsive spatial interactions and studied the swarming behaviors in populations of chiral swarmalators. The swarmalators move with constant velocity v along the direction governed by the phase , and the time evolution of phase dynamics is described by the Kuramoto model with local spatial interactions. The authors report various collective states formed by circling and clustering of swarmalators for distinct coupling strength and interaction radius.

The significant contribution of this paper is the detailed analysis and analytical investigation of collective states. However, some issues need to be addressed.

1. \omega_max and \omega_min are chosen as 3 and 1, respectively. How do the results change for different choices of \omega_max and \omega_min?

2. Whether the results are independent of the nature of the frequency distributions such as Lorenzian, and Gaussian? These will illustrate the generic nature of the results.

3. Similar collective states that involve circling and clustering behavior and hybrid states have already been reported in the literature [1, 2]. Hence the novel collective behavior particular to this model should be clearly stated to appreciate the merit of the manuscript.

4. Since the additive type of coupling is considered, How does the number of swarmalators (N) influence the collective dynamics?

5. Noise plays a crucial role in swarming models [3]. Are the observed collective states robust with respect to noise? It would be interesting to know how noise reshapes collective behavior.

These concerns should be addressed before considering the manuscript for publication.

Reviewer #2: In this manuscript, the authors have extensively studied the self-organized swarming dynamics of populations of spatially non-interacting chiral swarmalators with phase coupling, where they numerically demonstrated that their proposed model is able to mimic the self organization and emergence of a variety of coordinated spatial dynamics. In particular, the authors have derived the critical lines that gives the transitions between various ordered spatiotemporal states analytically, which agree well with the numerical results. Their findings make great contributions to the theoretical understanding of swarmalator dynamics. In my opinion, I think that their results are very consolidated and interesting, which have potential applications in artificial swarming systems and understanding natural swarming phenomena. Their manuscript is well written and clearly organized, I strongly recommend the publication of their work as it is

Data in Brief (optional):

We invite you to convert your supplementary data (or a part of it) into an additional journal publication in Data in Brief, a multi-disciplinary open access journal. Data in Brief articles are a fantastic way to describe supplementary data and associated metadata, or full raw datasets deposited in an external repository, which are otherwise unnoticed. A Data in Brief article (which will be reviewed, formatted, indexed, and given a DOI) will make your data easier to find, reproduce, and cite.

You can submit to Data in Brief via the XXX submission system when you upload your revised XXX manuscript. To do so, complete the template and follow the co-submission instructions found here: www.elsevier.com/dib-template. If your XXX manuscript is accepted, your Data in Brief submission will automatically be transferred to Data in Brief for editorial review and publication.

Please note: an open access Article Publication Charge (APC) is payable by the author or research funder to cover the costs associated with publication in Data in Brief and ensure your data article is immediately and permanently free to access by all. For the current APC see: www.elsevier.com/journals/data-in-brief/2352-3409/open-access-journal

Please contact the Data in Brief editorial office at dib-me@elsevier.com or visit the Data in Brief homepage (www.journals.elsevier.com/data-in-brief/) if you have questions or need further information."
